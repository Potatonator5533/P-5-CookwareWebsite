Cookware Website

My Recreation of a Cookware Website. Almost complete with just a few things unfortunately sill incomplete.

Peer Reviewer: Andrie  Amor
Peer Review: Everything seems to work well and website is very accurate to figma. The responsiveness is smooth and works well. Some text  gets too squished at some resolutions and the hero text on the first header is not responsive. The nav bar could use some work, isn't really responsive. Other than that this is really good work!
